# AR.js Workshop Guide

### Post Workshop Update
Pretty much covered everything that I wanted. I'm leaving ```index.html``` in its initial state and uploading all the finished code in a file called ```completed.html```

I also recorded the workshop and posted the video to YouTube: [link here](https://youtu.be/3hm2lgH0KW4)

### Quick Intro
My name is Micah Haycraft, [here's my website](https://mhaycraft.dev/), I'm a graduating UNC senior majoring in computer science and a developer for Carolina AR/VR. This past summer I helped lead a team to [build a web AR app for Arts Everywhere](https://artseverywhere.unc.edu/art-walk-on-franklin/), and here I'm going to try and teach you some of what I learned.

AR.js is an free open source augmented reality library for web development. 

- [AR.js Website](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/)
- [AR.js Repo](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js)

AR.js is a wrapper around the popular WebVR library A-Frame (which is itself a wrapper around Three.js). A-Frame uses an entity component system similar to what you may have seen if you've used Unity or Unreal for game development before.

- [A-Frame Website](https://aframe.io/)
- [A-Frame Repo](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe)

Together these two libraries make building web AR apps fairly straightforward. The structure is similar to writing HTML for a regular web page. But like anything there's still some quirks to figure out. Let's get started.

## Installation


1) Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)

2) Follow the [VS Code tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial) on installing and using Node.js or if you're already familiar with node then download it directly from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and proceed with setup. Running ```npm``` in a VS Code terminal should output something like this: 

![npm terminal output](https://i.imgur.com/7xg9Ztl.png)

3) Clone this repository and open as a VS Code project. You can do this directly with git or with VS Code's version control by going to View -> Command Palette -> Git Clone -> paste the repository clone link

4) With the project cloned and open in VS Code, go to Terminal -> New Terminal and run ```npm install``` and ```npm init```. When prompted for package name, version number, etc, just leave them blank and keep hitting enter. It should look something like this:

Note: This project currently uses the express framework for local development. Because the project is primarily intended to be used on mobile phones and not laptops, it is configured to require https, which is required by most mobile browsers in order to be able to request camera permission. So, we'll need to briefly hack together some fake certificates.

5) First you need to know your development computer's local IP on your home network. Open a command prompt and type ```ipconfig```, you want the number that comes up under 'ipv4'

6) Go to https://www.selfsignedcertificate.com/ and put in your dev computer's local IP address with a colon and port 8000 like this and download the .key and .cert files it generates for you

7)  Store them in the project directory, add the .key and .cert files' relative paths to the app.js file on lines 20 and 21 like this:

This should be the last step of setup.

## Usage

To run this demo and begin building more on top of it, open the VS Code terminal and run 

```node app.js```

On your phone or other device connected to the same local area network, open chrome or safari and navigate your dev computer's IP and port number in this structure:

 ```https://192.168.1.2:8000/``` 

It will pop up and complain that the certificates you generated earlier aren't valid, but you can tell your browser to trust the website anyways.

You should be prompted for permission to access your camera, after which you should be seeing your camera's view displayed in your browser.

Point your camera at this image:

You should see a red and green cube with like this:

## Further 

let's make these cubes a bit more interesting by showing the entity component / parent child structure at work

inside of <a-box> tags, lets insert another a-frame primitive
```
<a-torus-knot 
    radius='0.26' 
    radius-tubular='0.05'
    animation="property: rotation; to:360 0 0; dur: 5000; easing: linear; loop: true">
</a-torus-knot>
```

# _ok the workshop starts in like an hour so I'm done updating this. in the words of bill o'reilly we're doing it live._

Topics that we may cover during the workshop depending on time constraints include creating customer markers, using 3d models, adding touch interaction, linking all this stuff to arbitrary javascript with DOM elements like a button, and some useful tools like A-Frame inspector and chrome dev tools with adb.

After the workshop is done I'll upload a more complete version of index.html to this repo for anyone to reference.
